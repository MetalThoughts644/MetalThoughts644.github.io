            * `1/4 cup` Soy Sauce
            * `1/4 cup` Mirin
            * `1/4 cup` Sake
            * `1 tsp` Sugar

            >In a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients for the marinade

            <ul>
            <li><code>3 Tbsp</code> cornstarch</li>
            <li><code>2 Tbsp</code> water</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the water and set aside.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><code>6 Tbsp</code> unsalted butter</li>
            <li><code>1/4 cup</code> unbleached all purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and cook, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes, until the mixture turns golden brown.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><code>570ml</code> beef broth</li>
            <li><code>285ml</code> chicken broth</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add the beef and chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk. Stir in about HALF the cornstarch mixture and simmer for a minute or so. If you’d like your gravy thicker, add a more of the cornstarch mixture, in small increments, as needed, to thicken. Season with pepper. Taste and add additional salt, if necessary, to taste. Make ahead and re-warm or keep warm until your fries are ready.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><code>900g</code> Russet potatoes, (3-4 medium potatoes)</li>
            <li>Peanut or other frying oil</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Prepare your potatoes and cut into 1.25cm thick sticks. Place into a large bowl and cover completely with cold water. Allow to stand at least one hour or several hours. When ready to cook, heat your oil in your deep fryer or large, wide, heavy cooking pot to 150° C.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Remove the potatoes from the water and place onto a sheet of paper towel. Blot to remove as much excess moisture as possible.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add your fries to the 150°F oil and cook for 5-8 minutes, just until potatoes are starting to cook but are not yet browned. Remove potatoes from oil and scatter on a wire rack. Increase oil temperature to 190°C Once oil is heated to that temperature, return the potatoes to the fryer and cook until potatoes are golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined bowl.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add your fried or baked fries to a large, clean bowl. Season lightly with salt while still warm. Add a ladle of hot poutine gravy to the bowl and using tongs, toss the fries in the gravy. Add more gravy, as needed to mostly coat the fries.</p>

            <li><code>1 - 1 1/2 cups</code> white cheddar cheese curds, (Or torn chunks of mozzarella cheese would be the closest substitution)</li>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Add the cheese curds and toss with the hot fries and gravy. Serve with freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately.</p>
