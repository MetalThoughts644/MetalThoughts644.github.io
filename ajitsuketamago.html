            <p>Bring it to a boil and whisk it a few times to let the sugar dissolve completely. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Set aside to cool completely.</p>

            <li><code>4</code> Eggs</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add water to a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil. There should be enough water to cover the eggs by at least 2.5 cm. Once at a full boil, gently lower one egg at a time into the boiling water with a ladle. When you add the first egg, set a 7-minute timer. You can cook them 6 to 6½ minutes for a runny egg yolk and 8 to 9 minutes for a custard-like egg yolk.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Once all the eggs are in the saucepan, lower the heat to maintain a gentle boil. Make sure the water is simmering. If you want your egg yolks to be centered, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and shock them in iced water for 15 minutes.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Once the eggs are completely cool, gently crack the shell at the wide bottom end of the egg and start peeling it vertically toward the pointy top. Dip the egg in the iced water a few times to help with the peeling. Once you peel one section vertically, the rest of the shell comes off easily.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Place the eggs in a plastic bag and add the marinade to the bag.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Remove the air from the bag and use a clip or rubber band to seal the bag right above the eggs. This way, the eggs are completely submerged in the marinade. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.</p>
