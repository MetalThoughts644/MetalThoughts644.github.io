---

---

* `1 can` condensed tomato soup
* `2 tbs` tomato paste
* `1 small can` 4 bean mix (drained and rinsed)
* `1 handful` of fresh herbs (sprig rosemary, sprig thyme, sprig parsley)
* `2 tsp` beef stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

>Then add tomato soup, tomato paste, bean mix, fresh herbs, beef stock, Salt and pepper to taste, 2-3 cups boiling water

---

* `1 handful` of soup pasta
* `1/2 doz` diced green beans

>Simmer until veggies are soft, then add soup pasta, green beans.

>Simmer until the pasta is cooked. You may need to add more boiling water if itâ€™s looking a bit thick. I simmer it with the lid on, so as not to boil to much of the water off.
