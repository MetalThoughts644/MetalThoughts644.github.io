* `1/2 cup` unfed sourdough starter
* `1 cup` bread flour
* `1/4 cup` milk
* `1 tsp` sugar

>Make a stiff levain by mixing unfed starter with flour, milk and sugar. Place it in a semi-covered bowl and leave to rise overnight (8-12 hours) at room temperature.

---

* brandy or spiced rum or cognac
* dried mixed fruit

>Pour brandy over fruit in a shallow bowl and mix to coat. Leave to soak overnight.

---

* dash milk

>The next morning, the starter should have doubled in size. Place it in a large mixing bowl, add milk and a pinch of salt. Mix together into a cohesive dough. 

---

* `75 g` butter

>Cut room temperature butter into cubes. One piece at a time, slowly work the butter into the dough, kneeding it until butter is fully incorporated. Cover and leave to rest for an hour.

---

* slivered blanched almonds

>Stretch dough out and sprinkle with some of the fruit and nuts (approx a quarter). Fold in. Repeat until desired quantity of fruit and nuts have been added.

---

>Knead dough for 10 minutes until it's smooth, soft and elastic. Then shape into a tight ball. Transfer the Stollen roll onto a baking parchment-lined sheet. Carefully cover with lightly-greased clingfilm or a clean plastic bag and leave to rise for 2-3 hours until just about doubled in size.

---

>Once doubled, preheat the oven to 170Â°C Fan. Place Stollen in the centre of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes.

---

* melted butter
* icing sugar

>When cooked through, take it out of the oven and immediately brush with melted butter. Sift 2 tbsps of icing sugar all over the top and sides and leave to cool completely before slicing.
