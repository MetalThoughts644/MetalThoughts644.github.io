* `2` eggs, lightly beaten

>Heat a large (11-inches) nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pour into the center of the pool of oil. Swirl pan so that eggs coat the pan in as thin a layer as the pan will allow. Turn heat to low. Cook 20-30 seconds. The top may not look entirely cooked. Turn off the heat. Roll the egg pancake into a coil and transfer to a board. Thinly slice into ribbons. Set aside.

* `3 tbsp` soy sauce
* `3 tbsp` fish sauce
* `3 tbsp` brown sugar
* `3 tbsp` unseasoned rice vinegar

>Combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Set aside near your cooktop.

---

* `1` small iceberg lettuce
* `1 tsp` chilli flakes
* `1 bunch` scallions, thinly sliced
* `1 cup` roasted peanuts, roughly chopped

>Slice the letuce into 1cm pieces, and transfer to a large bowl. Arrange everything else in small bowls near your cooktop: the chilli flakes, scallions, nuts, eggs.

---

* `225g` wide rice noodles

>Cook rice noodles, drain.

---

* `2 tbsp` neutral oil

>Heat a skillet or wok over high heat. Add the oil and the pepper flakes, followed immediately by the noodles â€” be careful adding the noodles as water clinging to them will spatter. Use tongs to quickly coat the noodles in the oil; then add the sauce, and use tongs again to coat them in the sauce. Add everything else: the scallions, egg, and nuts, and toss to combine. Cook for about a minute total; then pour everything over the lettuce. Toss gently to combine. Serve immediately, passing more hot sauce on the side, if you wish.
