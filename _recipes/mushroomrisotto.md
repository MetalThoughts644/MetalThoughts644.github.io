* `500g` mushrooms, sliced 3 mm thick
* `250g` mushrooms, quartered
* `3 tbsp` butter

>Add 1 tbsp oil and half the butter in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Once melted, add half the mushrooms and cook until pretty golden brown (~4 min).

---

* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `2` garlic cloves, minced
* `1/2 tsp` salt and pepper, each

>Add 1/2 the garlic, 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper, then continue to cook until golden brown (~1.5 min). Then remove into bowl. Repeat with remaining mushrooms, then remove.

---

* `1 tbsp` butter
* `1` garlic clove, minced
* `1/2` onion

>Turn heat down to medium. In the same pot, melt butter then add garlic and onion. Cook 2 minutes until onion is translucent but not golden.

---

* `1/4 cup` dry white wine
* `1 1/4 cups` arborio rice, uncooked
* `5 cups` chicken stock, warm

>Add wine and allow to simmer rapidly for 2 minutes, scraping the base of the pot, until mostly evaporated. Add rice and stir for 1 minute until semi translucent.

---

>Add about 1.5 cups of stock. Stir, then leave for 3 minutes, stirring just a few times, until mostly absorbed (~3 min).

---

>Add about 1.5 cups stock, stir every now and then until mostly absorbed (~3 min) â€“ no need to stir constantly. Repeat twice (or once. check rice for doneness as you go) more until all stock used up, rice is just cooked but risotto still creamy and sloppy (~10 min).

---

* `1/2 cup` cream
* `30g` butter
* `1/2 cup` parmesan cheese, finely grated
* `1/2 tsp` salt and pepper, each

>Add cream and butter, stir vigorously to make creamy. Stir in parmesan, salt and pepper.

---

>Stir through half the mushrooms, then taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Consistency should be creamy, not stodgy.

---

* Finely chopped parsley or chives
* Parmesan, freshly grated

>Reheat remaining mushrooms. Spoon risotto into bowls, then top with reserved mushrooms (including a drizzle of buttery juices pooled in bowl). Garnish with parsley if using, and extra parmesan. Serve immediately.
