* `100g` Egg whites
* `200 g` white sugar 

>Place egg whites and sugar into the Thermomix Bowl. Mix for 5 minutes at 70c Speed 2. Check that all the sugar has dissolved by rubbing a bit between your fingertips. You should not be able to feel any sugar crystals. If you can, beat for 2-3 more minutes and check again.

>Place the butterfly into the bowl and mix for 10 minutes at speed 4. At this stage the mixture should be smooth and glossy and form stiff peaks.If the mix has not yet cooled to room temperature, keep beating until the bowl is no longer warm to touch. This could take another 10-20 minutes. If you are short on time, transfer the mix to a stainless steel or glass bowl and sit in a basin of cold water. Once the bowl is cool to touch, tranfer the mix back to your TM bowl and continue.

* `300 g` unsalted butter, cubed

>Mix for 3-4 minutes at speed 4, slowly adding the butter bit by bit through the lid. Don't worry if it looks a little curdly along the way, it should all come back together.

>At this stage you can add colour or flavour of your choice. Suggestions are; vanilla extract (1 tsp), chocolate (100g melted and cooled)(I like to both add chocolate and coffee to taste), orange oil, lemon oil etc
