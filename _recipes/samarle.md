* `1` large cabbage

>Carefully separate the leaves from head of cabbage. Bring a large and generously salted pot of water to a boil, and cook the leaves for about 3 minutes. Remove the leaves and let them cool. Cut out the thickest part of each leaf at the bottom by slicing on each side of the rib to form a triangle.

---

* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1` large onion, chopped
* `1/2 cup` long grain rice

>Heat the oil in pan, add the onions and cook until softened and translucent. Add the rice and cook for another minute. 

---

* `900g` pork mince
* `1/4 cup` parsley, chopped
* `1/4 cup` dill, chopped

>In a large bowl, add the ground pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill and the onion and rice mixture. Mix well.

---

>Preheat oven to 190 C

---

>Fill each leaf with about a 1/4 cup of the meat mixture and roll, tucking in the ends. Repeat with all the remaining meat and cabbage leaves.

---

* `15 slices` bacon, chopped

>Chop leftover cabbage leaves and spread some on the bottom of a large dutch oven. Place the cabbage rolls on the chopped cabbage in a single layer. Top generously with bacon.

---

>Finish with another layer of cabbage rolls, more bacon and a bit more chopped cabbage.

---

* `4 cups` tomato juice

>Pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls and add additional water as needed, making sure rolls are completely submerged.

---

>Cover the Dutch oven with a lid and transfer it to the oven. Bake for 2 hours, then remove the lid and cook for another 1 to 1.5 hours.

---

>Serve with sour cream.
