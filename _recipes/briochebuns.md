* `20 g` whole psyllium husk
* `280 g` warm water

>In a bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and warm water.

---

* `230 g` tapioca starch (or potato starch)
* `135 g` millet flour, plus extra for flouring the surface
* `60 g` sorghum flour 
* `50 g` sugar
* `8 g` instant yeast
* `8 g` baking powder
* `7 g` xanthan gum
* `12 g` salt

>In a large bowl, whisk together the tapioca starch, millet flour, sorghum flour, sugar, instant yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt.

---

* `120 g` whole milk, lukewarm
* `2` large eggs, room temperature
* `50 g` neutral oil

>Add the milk, eggs and oil to the psyllium gel, and mix well to combine.

---

>Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the psyllium gel-egg mixture.

---

>Knead the dough until smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated, then knead for a further or 6-8 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent any dry patches of unmixed flour.

---

>Turn out the dough onto a generously floured surface, and dust the top of the dough with flour as well. Give it a gentle knead (with floured hands) and shape it into a ball.

---

>Divide it into 8 equal portions, each should weigh about 130g.

---

>Again working on a floured surface, shape each portion into a ball, making sure that its surface is fairly smooth.

---

>Arrange the shaped burger buns on a large lined baking sheet, making sure that they're spaced as far apart as possible, as they will increase in size during both proofing and baking.

---

>Lightly cover the burger buns with a sheet of glad wrap and proof in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.

---

>Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 190Ëš.

---

>Once the burger buns have doubled in size, bake at for about 14-15 minutes or until the burger buns are deep golden brown on top.

---

>Immediately transfer the burger buns onto a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cooled completely to room temperature.
