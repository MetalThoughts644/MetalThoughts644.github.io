* `500g` lamb leg or shoulder, 3cm cubes

>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and sear the meat over high heat from all sides until golden brown.

---

* `1` onion, finely diced
* `3` cloves garlic, finely diced

>Remove the meat from the pan and transfer the onions to the same pan. Gently fry them over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Then add the chopped garlic and fry both together for a further 3 minutes.

---

* `8` golden sour prunes
* `1/4 cup` tomato paste
* `1` cinnamon stick
* `1 tsp` turmeric
* `1/2 tsp` black pepper

>Add meat back to pan with golden sour prunes, tomato paste, cinnamon stick, turmeric, black pepper and salt to taste. 

---

* `1/4 cup` yellow split peas

>If you have the Iranian/Middle Eastern yellow split peas add them now. The Iranian split peas take much longer to cook than the ones found in UK supermarkets. If you don’t have the Iranian ones, pre-cook them separately in salted boiling water until cooked. Drain the water and set the split peas aside until it’s time to add them to the stew. 

---

>Add 2 cups of freshly boiled water to the other ingredients. Bring the stew to a simmer, then reduce the temperature to between low and medium. Put the lid on and let it simmer for 1 hour. 

---

* `250g` quince, chopped

>Sauté the quince in vegetable oil for about 5 min.

---

* `3 tsp` sugar
* `2-3 tbsp` lemon juice

>Add the chopped quince to the stew and let them cook in it for 20 minutes. Add the sugar and lemon juice, as well as the cooked yellow split peas, if you boiled them separately. Add more salt if needed. Let the stew cook for another 10 minutes.

>Serve with aromatic Persian rice.
