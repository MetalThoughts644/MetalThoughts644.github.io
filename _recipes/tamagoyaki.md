Here down is where you want steps/ingredients. An example of a step is:
---

* `1/4 cup` Soy Sauce
* `1/4 cup` Mirin
* `1/4 cup` Sake
* `1 tsp` Sugar

>In a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients for the marinade

---
Note the triple dashes, paragraph spaces, back dashes and other formatting.
-->

* `3` large eggs

>In a bowl, gently whisk eggs. It‘s best to “cut“ the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion; do not overmix.

---

* `3 Tbsp` dashi
* `2 tsp` sugar
* `1 tsp` soy sauce
* `1 tsp` mirin
* `2 pinches` Diamond Crystal kosher salt

>In another bowl, combine the seasonings. Mix well.

---

>Pour the seasonings mixture into the eggs and whisk gently to combine. Then, pour the mixture into a measuring cup with a spout and handle so that it‘ll be easier to pour into the frying pan.

---

>Heat the pan over medium heat. Then, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply a thin layer of oil to the pan. To check if the pan is hot enough, put a drop of the egg mixture in the pan. When you hear a sizzling sound, the pan is ready. Then, pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the pan, quickly tilting the pan so that the egg mixture coats the entire cooking surface.

---

>Poke any air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but is still soft on top, start rolling the egg into a log shape from one side to the other, starting from the far side of the pan and rolling toward the pan handle.

---

>Move the rolled omelette to the far side of the pan where you started to roll and apply more oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette. Pour in a thin layer of the egg mixture to just cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.

---

>When the new layer of egg has set and is still soft on top, start rolling it from one side to the other.

---

>When the new layer of egg has set and is still soft on top, start rolling it from one side to the other. Continue until you’ve used all of the egg mixture.

---

>Remove it from the pan and place the omelette on a bamboo sushi mat. While it’s still hot, roll up the omelette in the bamboo mat to help set its shape. Let it stand for 5 minutes.

---

>Slice the omelette into 1 cm pieces.

---

* `85g` daikon radish (2.5 cm use the sweeter, greenish part near the top of the radish)
* soy sauce

>Peel and grate radish. Gently squeeze the water out and place in a small dish or bowl. Pour soy sauce over the grated daikon and serve on the side with the Tamagoyaki.
