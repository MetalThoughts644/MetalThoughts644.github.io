* `1.5kg` whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces
* `12 cups` water
* `2` large carrots, quartered
* `2` stalks celery, quartered
* `1` large onion, peeled and halved
* `2` bay leaves
* `5` whole black peppercorns
* `2 tsp` salt, more to taste

>Add the chicken, water, carrots, celery, onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt to a large stockpot. Bring to a rapid boil, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

---

>Remove the chicken and vegetables to a bowl and carefully strain the broth through a fine sieve into a separate large bowl. Return the strained broth to the stockpot and bring to a boil.

---

* `1/2 cup` rice

>Add the rice and cook.

---

* `3` large eggs, room temperature
* `1 tsp` fresh lemon zest
* `4 to 6 tbsp` freshly squeezed lemon juice

>While the rice is cooking, prepare the egg-lemon mixture. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until nice and frothy. Add the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a steady stream while continuing to whisk.

---

>When the rice has finished cooking, turn off the heat. Ladle about 2 cups of broth into a large measuring cup.

---

>Slowly add the hot broth to the egg-lemon mixture while continuing to whisk. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling once they are added to the hot broth.

---

>Continuously stir the egg-lemon mixture back into the pot over very low heat until the mixture is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to boil the soup once the eggs have been added. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

* Fresh dill sprigs, for garnish

>Garnish with dill and serve.
