* `1.4kg` chuck roast, brisket, or flank steak
* `2 tbsp` (or more if using flank steak) extra-virgin olive oil

>Pat roast dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a large heatproof pot over high. Cook chuck roast, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides, 5–7 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

* `2` large onions, chopped
* `2` red bell peppers, chopped
* `2 tbsp` Diamond Crystal or 3½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt
* `8` garlic cloves, finely grated
* `1/2` cup dry white wine
* `4 tsp` sweet paprika
* `1 tbsp` dried Mexican or Italian oregano
* `2 tsp` ground cumin
* `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `1/2 tsp` cayenne pepper
* `800g can` whole peeled tomatoes

>Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 150°. Cook onion, bell peppers, and salt (plus 2 Tbsp. oil if using flank steak), stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 12–14 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pan, until vegetables are golden brown, 3–5 minutes. Stir in wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until evaporated. Stir in paprika, oregano, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne until vegetables are coated; continue to cook, stirring, until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and coarsely break up with a spoon (they’ll continue to break down as they cook). Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.

* `2` bay leaves

>Nestle roast into tomato mixture and tuck in bay leaves on either side. Cover and transfer to oven. Braise roast and vegetables until meat is very tender and shreds easily, 2½–3 hours. Let cool 15 minutes.

---


* `3/4 cup` pimiento-stuffed Spanish olives, halved crosswise
* `2 tsp` distilled white vinegar

>Skim excess fat from sauce; discard bay leaves. Using a potato masher or 2 forks, tear and smash beef into sauce until it’s shredded and incorporated into sauce. Stir in olives and vinegar.
