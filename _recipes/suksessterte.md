>Preheat oven to 175°C and grease cake tin (27 cm spring form)

---

* `300g` Almonds

>Grind almonds in an almond grinder or food processor. I like to keep them a bit coarse.
---

* `3`eggs
* `300g` white sugar
* `2 tbsp` flour
* `1 tsp` baking powder

>Using a hand mixer, whisk eggs and sugar together until thick. Carefully fold in the ground almonds, flour, and baking powder.

---

>Pour batter into cake form and bake for about one hour, monitoring to make sure the top doesn't burn.

---

* `5` egg yolks
* `100` ml heavy cream
* `85 g` granulated sugar
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract

>Add egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla to a saucepan. Heat over low/medium heat while stirring constantly until the mixture thickens – about 15 minutes. Turn up the heat if the mixture doesn't thicken, but be careful not to boil.

---

* `100g` butter

>Let the mixture cool to room temperature and then add the butter. You can use an electric mixer for a fluffy egg cream.

---

>Wait for the cake to cool completely before removing from form and frosting.
