            <ul>
            <li><code>1</code> fresh or organic chicken (about
            1.5kg)</li>
            <li><code>1</code> tablespoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the
            piece of chicken fat at the back cavity. Transfer the
            chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Lightly
            rub the chicken with the salt. Set it aside.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <ul>
            <li><code>12-14 cups</code> water</li>
            <li><code>4-5cm</code> ginger</li>
            <li><code>2</code> whole scallions</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to
            a boil in a large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the
            pot, rinse the chicken under running water to wash away the
            salt. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water,
            positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a good time
            to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes
            above the water (so you aren’t left with dry white
            meat).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of
            the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in
            the cavity. Carefully lower the chicken back into the pot.
            Bring the water to a boil again, and cover the lid. Turn off
            the heat, and leave the pot covered on the stove for 45-50
            minutes. To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick
            into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the juices run
            clear, it’s cooked through.</p>

            <p>*Ice</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>When the 45-minute time is almost up, prepare a large ice
            bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken
            out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it
            into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin. After 15
            minutes in the ice bath, the chicken should be cooled
            completely, drain and cover with clear plastic until ready
            to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process,
            locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better
            texture.</p>

            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>While the chicken is cooling, make the rice. Heat a wok
            over medium heat. Add the chicken fat and render for about a
            minute. Stir in the minced garlic and fry briefly, making
            sure it doesn’t burn.</p>

            saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic
            and just lightly caramelized. You want it to be just cooked
            so that it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked
            ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce

            ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the sesame oil,
