            <p>In a bowl, gently whisk eggs. It‘s best to “cut“ the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion; do not overmix.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Pour the seasonings mixture into the eggs and whisk gently to combine. Then, pour the mixture into a measuring cup with a spout and handle so that it‘ll be easier to pour into the frying pan.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Heat the pan over medium heat. Then, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply a thin layer of oil to the pan. To check if the pan is hot enough, put a drop of the egg mixture in the pan. When you hear a sizzling sound, the pan is ready. Then, pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the pan, quickly tilting the pan so that the egg mixture coats the entire cooking surface.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Poke any air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but is still soft on top, start rolling the egg into a log shape from one side to the other, starting from the far side of the pan and rolling toward the pan handle.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Move the rolled omelette to the far side of the pan where you started to roll and apply more oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette. Pour in a thin layer of the egg mixture to just cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.</p>
